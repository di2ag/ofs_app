# adding functional meta data for a KP app
This is the functional data that the app relies on for functionality.
DO NOT include the data to be loaded into the api's database. That should be handled by chp_db
The functional data files required are:
    - conflation_map.json
    - curies_database.json
    - meta_knowledge_graph.json
    - epc.json

## conflation_map.json

## curies_database.json

## meta_knowledge_graph.json

## epc.json
